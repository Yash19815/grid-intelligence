# 🏎️ Grid Intelligence: F1 Data Analytics Dashboard

**Grid Intelligence** is an interactive Power BI analytics suite designed to transform raw Formula 1 historical data into actionable racing insights. By visualizing decades of race results, this project uncovers the hidden patterns behind driver dominance, constructor hierarchies, and evolving team strategies.
